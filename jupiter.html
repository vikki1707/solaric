            <p style="text-align:justify; margin:20px;font-size:30px; font-family:Helevetica; ">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.</p><hr>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin:20px;font-size:20px;  ">Jupiter was the first planet to form, and its inward migration during the primordial Solar System impacted much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen (90% by volume), followed by helium, which makes up a quarter of its mass and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Its internal structure is believed to comprise an outer mantle of liquid metallic hydrogen, and a diffuse inner core of denser material. Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours, Jupiter's shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since 1831 and possibly earlier.
Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere, the second largest contiguous structure in the Solar System (after the heliosphere). Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon.

<p style="text-align:justify; margin:20px;font-size:60px; font-family:Helevetica; text-decoration-line:underline;">Name and symbol</p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin:20px;font-size:20px;  ">In both the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, Jupiter was named after the chief god of the divine pantheon: Zeus to the Greeks and Jupiter to the Romans.[17] The International Astronomical Union formally adopted the name Jupiter for the planet in 1976, and has since named its newly discovered satellites for the god's lovers, favourites, and descendants.[18] The planetary symbol for Jupiter, ♃, descends from a Greek zeta with a horizontal stroke, ⟨Ƶ⟩, as an abbreviation for Zeus.[19][20]

In Latin, Iovis is the genitive case of Iuppiter, i.e. Jupiter. It is associated with the etymology of Zeus ('sky father'). The English equivalent, Jove, is only known to have come into use as a poetic name for the planet around the 14th century.[21]

Jovian is the adjectival form of Jupiter. The older adjectival form jovial, employed by astrologers in the Middle Ages, has come to mean 'happy' or 'merry', moods ascribed to Jupiter's influence in astrology.[22]

The original Greek deity Zeus supplies the root zeno-, which is used to form some Jupiter-related words, such as zenographic.[c].</p><hr>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin:20px;font-size:60px; font-family:Helevetica; text-decoration-line:underline;">Formation and migration</p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin:20px;font-size:20px;  ">Jupiter is believed to be the oldest planet in the Solar System, having formed just one million years after the Sun and roughly 50 million years before Earth.[23] Current models of Solar System formation suggest that Jupiter formed at or beyond the snow line: a distance from the early Sun where the temperature was sufficiently cold for volatiles such as water to condense into solids.[24] The planet began as a solid core, which then accumulated its gaseous atmosphere. As a consequence, the planet must have formed before the solar nebula was fully dispersed.[25] During its formation, Jupiter's mass gradually increased until it had 20 times the mass of the Earth, approximately half of which was made up of silicates, ices and other heavy-element constituents.[23] When the proto-Jupiter grew larger than 50 Earth masses it created a gap in the solar nebula.[23] Thereafter, the growing planet reached its final mass in 3–4 million years.[23] Since Jupiter is made of the same elements as the Sun (hydrogen and helium) it has been suggested that the Solar System might have been early in its formation a system of multiple protostars, which are quite common, with Jupiter being the second but failed protostar. But the Solar System never developed into a system of multiple stars and Jupiter today does not qualitfy as a protostar or brown dwarf since it has not enough mass to fuse hydrogen.[26][27][28]<br><br>

According to the "grand tack hypothesis", Jupiter began to form at a distance of roughly 3.5 AU (520 million km; 330 million mi) from the Sun. As the young planet accreted mass, interaction with the gas disk orbiting the Sun and orbital resonances with Saturn caused it to migrate inward.[24][29] This upset the orbits of several super-Earths orbiting closer to the Sun, causing them to collide destructively.[30] Saturn would later have begun to migrate inwards too, much faster than Jupiter, until the two planets became captured in a 3:2 mean motion resonance at approximately 1.5 AU (220 million km; 140 million mi) from the Sun.[31] This changed the direction of migration, causing them to migrate away from the Sun and out of the inner system to their current locations.[30] All of this happened over a period of 3–6 million years, with the final migration of Jupiter occurring over several hundred thousand years.[29][32] Jupiter's migration from the inner solar system eventually allowed the inner planets—including Earth—to form from the rubble<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin:20px;font-size:60px; font-family:Helevetica; text-decoration-line:underline;">Physical characteristics</p><br>
<p style="text-align:justify; margin:20px;font-size:20px;  ">Jupiter is a gas giant, being primarily composed of gas and liquid rather than solid matter. It is the largest planet in the Solar System, with a diameter of 142,984 km (88,846 mi) at its equator, giving it a volume 1,321 times that of the Earth.[2][41] Its average density, 1.326 g/cm3, [d] is lower than those of the four terrestrial planets. <br><br>
<img src="jupyter0.jpg" class="center"><br><br>
By mass, Jupiter's atmosphere is approximately 76% hydrogen and 24% helium, though, because helium atoms are more massive than hydrogen molecules, Jupiter's upper atmosphere is about 90% hydrogen and 10% helium by volume.[45] The atmosphere also contains trace amounts of methane, water vapour, ammonia, and silicon-based compounds as well as fractional amounts of carbon, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, neon, oxygen, phosphine, and sulfur.[46] The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains crystals of frozen ammonia.[47] Through infrared and ultraviolet measurements, trace amounts of benzene and other hydrocarbons have also been found.[48] The interior of Jupiter contains denser materials—by mass it is roughly 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 5% other elements.

<p style="text-align:justify; margin:20px;font-size:60px; font-family:Helevetica; text-decoration-line:underline;">Size and mass</p><br>
<p style="text-align:justify; margin:20px;font-size:20px;  ">Jupiter's mass is 318 times that of Earth;[2] 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. It is so massive that its barycentre with the Sun lies above the Sun's surface at 1.068 solar radii from the Sun's centre.[57] [58]: 6  Jupiter's radius is about one tenth the radius of the Sun,[59] and its mass is one thousandth the mass of the Sun, as the densities of the two bodies are similar.[60] A "Jupiter mass" (MJ or MJup) is often used as a unit to describe masses of other objects, particularly extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. For example, the extrasolar planet HD 209458 b has a mass of 0.69 MJ, while the brown dwarf Gliese 229 b has a mass of 60.4 MJ.[61][62]

Theoretical models indicate that if Jupiter had over 40% more mass, the interior would be so compressed that its volume would decrease despite the increasing amount of matter. For smaller changes in its mass, the radius would not change appreciably.[63] As a result, Jupiter is thought to have about as large a diameter as a planet of its composition and evolutionary history can achieve.[64] The process of further shrinkage with increasing mass would continue until appreciable stellar ignition was achieved.[65] Although Jupiter would need to be about 75 times more massive to fuse hydrogen and become a star,[66] its diameter is sufficient as the smallest red dwarf may be only slightly larger in radius than Saturn.<br><br>

Like all stars, our Sun will eventually run out of energy. When it starts to die, the Sun will expand into a red giant star, becoming so large that it will engulf Mercury and Venus, and possibly Earth as well. Scientists predict the Sun is a little less than halfway through its lifetime and will last another 5 billion years or so before it becomes a white dwarf.</p><br><br>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin:20px;font-size:60px; font-family:Helevetica; text-decoration-line:underline;">Internal structure</p><br>
<p style="text-align:justify; margin:20px;font-size:20px;  ">Before the early 21st century, most scientists proposed one of two scenarios for the formation of Jupiter. If the planet accreted first as a solid body, it would consist of a dense core, a surrounding layer of liquid metallic hydrogen (with some helium) extending outward to about 80% of the radius of the planet,[73] and an outer atmosphere consisting primarily of molecular hydrogen.[71] Alternatively, if the planet collapsed directly from the gaseous protoplanetary disk, it was expected to completely lack a core, consisting instead of a denser and denser fluid (predominantly molecular and metallic hydrogen) all the way to the centre. Data from the Juno mission showed that Jupiter has a diffuse core that mixes into its mantle, extending for 30–50% of the planet's radius, and comprising heavy elements with a combined mass 7–25 times the Earth.[74][75][76][77][78] This mixing process could have arisen during formation, while the planet accreted solids and gases from the surrounding nebula.[79] Alternatively, it could have been caused by an impact from a planet of about ten Earth masses a few million years after Jupiter's formation, which would have disrupted an originally solid Jovian core.<hr>
